Registration only asks about age and gender to be used for data science purposes. Users can anonymously report symptoms and choose a location to see the density of symptoms in a map view. The data is aggregated by places, therefore, the app can help people avoid visiting a grocery store or a gas station that is heavily used by symptomatic people.
