This is far from true and is killing many people from various age groups. \nIt is true that the risk of dying due to COVID-19 is significantly higher for 80+ age groups(as high as 14.8%) while it’s below 1% for age groups below 40. But this doesn’t mean that teenagers won’t be affected or die of this disease either because the virus is winning over the immune system or due to the fact that a large number of people are being infected and admitted to the hospital causing a toll on health care systems resulting in some patients not getting treated as effectively as they should be. \nWhich is why you should be careful not to get the disease and stay safe. Even if you are not heavily sick, there is a very huge chance that you might be affected and continue to pass it to others before the symptoms arise if you go to crowded areas or don’t keep social distancing.",

For instance, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is transmitted to humans from camels, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) is transmitted to humans from civet cats. \nAs of 30 March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak had caused over 700 000 cases worldwide since the first case was reported in China in January 2020. Of these, more than 30 000 are known to have died. ",

The coronavirus is not only able to spread to others by direct contacts like touching each other’s hands but also through indirect contacts like digital devices like phones,  desks, chairs, stairs, and elevator buttons and then touching your face (eyes, nose, or mouth).",

It also appears to be more transmissible than seasonal influenza. As it is a new virus, nobody has prior immunity, which means that the entire human population is potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. To make matters more pressing, not many preparations have been made on testing among other things during the outbreak of a pandemic.",
